## Generative Artificial Intelligence making Momentary Mood Music

This a project we are doing for an AI assignment at the HKU and the University of Utrecht.
Our goal is to create an AI algorithm that can generate music near-realtime based on given valence, arousal and other emotional floats.
This will be implemented in a game engine like Unreal Engine or Unity.
